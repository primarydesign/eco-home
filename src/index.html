      <h2>Q: What is a home energy rating?</h2>
        <p>A: The home energy rating is a standard measurement of the home&#8217;s energy efficiency. An energy rating allows a home buyer to easily compare the energy costs for the homes being considered.</p>
        <h2>Q: What is involved in a home energy rating?</h2>
        <p>A: Home energy ratings involve an on-site inspection by a residential energy efficiency professional &#8211; a home energy rater. Home energy raters are trained and certified by a RESNET accredited home energy rating system.</p>
        <p>The home energy rater inspects the home and measures its energy characteristics, such as insulation levels, window efficiency, wall-to-window ratios, the heating and cooling system efficiency, and the solar orientation of the home.</p>
        <p>Performance testing, such as a blower door test measuring door and duct leakage may be used. The home receives a point score between 1 and 100, depending on its relative efficiency. An estimate of the home&#8217;s energy costs is also provided. A homeowner who wants to upgrade the energy efficiency can use the energy rating to evaluate and pinpoint specific, cost-effective improvements.</p>
            <h2>Q: Can I trust the results of a home energy rating?</h2>
        <p>A: Home energy ratings must meet the stringent standards developed by RESNET. We abide by a code of ethics, rating standards of practice, and most disclose all financial interests to the client. The mortgage industry recognizes the rating to qualify for an energy efficient mortgage.</p>
        <h2>Q: What can I do with an energy rating?</h2>
        <p>A: The energy rating provides the following benefits:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>When buying a home a rating allows you to compare homes according to their energy efficiency.</li>
            <li>A rating allows you to know the energy performance of your home and identifies cost effective improvements that you can make to increase your comfort and home&#8217;s performance.</li>
            <li>A rating is required to qualify the home for an energy efficient mortgage</li>
            <li>A rating is required for a home to be labeled as ENERGY STAR</li>
        </ol>
