    <h1 class="headline">What We Do</h1>
    <p>Welcome to EcoHome Services. We help our customers comply with the myriad of regulations and program thresholds. We are certified HERS<sup>&reg;</sup> raters.</p>
    <p>Let’s face it, with the world’s dependency on oil growing stronger and the supply getting lower, it has never been more important to conserve energy. Not to mention, saving energy saves money!</p>
  <h1 class="headline">Our Services</h1>
    <p>Eco Home Services offers a wide range of services to design professionals, contractors, and homeowners. Cities across Massachusetts are actively implementing energy conservation to their building code. </p>
      <p>We conduct pre-construction design analysis to determine the most cost effective compliance path, and to optimize energy efficiency and rebate incentives. We're in a three year national energy code update cycle, combined with a MA specific “stretch code” cycle and additional requirements reference from these codes.</p>
      <p>Just when you’ve become accustomed to the energy code it changes. What are the applicable requirements for your project? Are the compliance requirments base code or stretch code? What more is required to meet the rebate program or Energy Star<sup>&reg;</sup> thresholds? We will guide you through the confusion and misinformation.</p>
    <p>Our Base Code and Stretch Code compliance services include:</p>
    <h2 class="service">Pre-Construction Analysis</h2>
    <h2 class="service">HERS<sup>&reg;</sup> Ratings</h2>
    <h2 class="service">Building Infiltration Testing (Blower Door Tests)</h2>
    <h2 class="service">Duct Leakage Tests</h2>

  <h1 class="faq__headline">FAQs</h1>    
  <h2 class="accordion-toggle">Q: What is a home energy rating?</h2>
    <div class="accordion-content default">
    <p>A: The home energy rating is a standard measurement of the home&#8217;s energy efficiency. An energy rating allows a home buyer to easily compare the energy costs for the homes being considered.</p>    
  </div>
  <h2 class="accordion-toggle">Q: What's involved in a home energy rating?</h2>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>A: Home energy ratings involve an on-site inspection by a residential energy efficiency professional &#8211; a home energy rater. Home energy raters are trained and certified by a RESNET<sup>&reg;</sup> accredited home energy rating system.</p>
    <p>The home energy rater inspects the home and measures its energy characteristics, such as insulation levels, window efficiency, wall-to-window ratios, the heating and cooling system efficiency, and the solar orientation of the home.</p>
    <p>Performance testing, such as a blower door test measuring door and duct leakage may be used. The home receives a point score between 1 and 100, depending on its relative efficiency. An estimate of the home&#8217;s energy costs is also provided. A homeowner who wants to upgrade the energy efficiency can use the energy rating to evaluate and pinpoint specific, cost-effective improvements.</p>
  </div>
  <h2 class="accordion-toggle">Q: Can I trust the results of a home energy rating?</h2>
  <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>A: Home energy ratings must meet the stringent standards developed by RESNET<sup>&reg;</sup>. We abide by a code of ethics, rating standards of practice, and most disclose all financial interests to the client. The mortgage industry recognizes the rating to qualify for an energy efficient mortgage.</p>
